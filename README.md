# 👋 INTRO

Shizue is a Chrome extension designed for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into the daily Browse workflow. The project aims to enhance browser interactions with LLM-driven features, conceptually similar to how tools like Cursor augment code editors.

Shizue provides a free, open-source alternative to commercial services (e.g., [Sider](https://sider.ai/pricing)) that restricts access to newer models behind paywalls. It enables users to utilize their own API keys for direct access to LLM functionalities, such as page summarization and bilingual webpage translation.
